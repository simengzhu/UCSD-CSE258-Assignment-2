## Tasks  
Report should have five components, each worth 5 percent of grade.  
1. Identify a **dataset** to study, perform an exploratory analysis of the data. **Describe** the dataset, including its **basic statistics and properties**, and report any **interesting findings**. This exploratory analysis should motivate the design of your model in the following sections. Datasets should be **reasonably large**(e.g. more than 50000 samples).

2. Identify a **predictive task** that can be studied on this dataset. Describe **how you will evaluate** your model at this predictive task, what relevant **baselines** can be used for comparison, and how you will **assess the validity** of your model's predictions. It's fine to use models that were described in class here (i.e, you **don't have to invent anything new** (though you may!)), though you should **explain and justify which model was appropriate** for the task. It's also important in this section to carefully describe what features you will use and how you had to process the data to obtain them.

3. Describe your **model**. Explain and justify your **decision to use the model** you proposed. How will you **optimize** it? Did you run into any **issues due to scalability, overfitting,** etc.? What **other models** did you consider for comparison? What were your **unsuccessful attempts** along the way? What are the **strengths and weaknesses** of the different models being compared?

4. Describe **literature** related to the problem you are studying. If you are using an **existing dataset**, **where did it come from** and **how was it used**? What **other similar datasets** have been studied in the past and how? What are the **state-of-the-art methods** currently employed to study **this type of data**? Are the conclusions from existing work **similar to or different** from your **own findings**?

5. Describe your **results** and conclusions. **How well** does your model perform **compared to alternatives**, and what is the **significance** of the results? **Which feature representations worked well** and which do not? What is the **interpretation of your modelâ€™s parameters**? **Why did the proposed model succeed** why others failed (or if it failed, why did it fail)?

### Git Workflow
1. Synchronize code from remote repo  
  `git pull origin master`
2. Make some changes  
3. Check status of all changes  
  `git status`  
4. Add changes to local buffer  
  `git add --all`  
5. Commit changes  
  `git commit -m "[qinacme]: Something done."`
6. Synchronize before push(When conflicts comes, contact qinacme)  
  `git pull origin master`  
7. Push to remote(Finish today's work)  
  `git push origin master`
